## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The codebase follows a simple structure with an index.html file as the entry point and a style.css file in the css directory. It uses the Bootstrap CSS framework for styling and includes custom CSS for additional styling. The codebase is a front-end web developer portfolio with a header, main section, and different sections for skills, work, about me, and contact. The codebase is organized in a straightforward and easy-to-understand manner.|
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The codebase relies on Bootstrap CSS framework for its styling. The Bootstrap CSS file is included in the HTML file using a link tag. There are no other external dependencies or reliance on other systems.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The codebase demonstrates modularity by organizing different sections into separate HTML div elements and CSS classes. Each section has its own styling and can be easily modified or replaced. The code also uses CSS variables for consistent font size and color management. Overall, the codebase is well-structured and allows for easy component reusability.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | The codebase does not include any testing strategies or tools. As a front-end web developer portfolio, it doesn't have complex logic or functionality that necessitates extensive testing. However, manual testing should be performed to ensure proper rendering and functionality across different browsers and devices.|
| ⚡️  | **Performance**    | As the codebase is a static website, performance is generally good. However, there is room for optimization. Making use of caching for static resources and optimizing image file sizes could further improve page load times. |
| 🔐 | **Security**       | The repository does not implement any specific security measures. However, since it is a simple front-end portfolio website, security risks are minimal. No user inputs or sensitive data handling is involved.|
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The repository uses Git for version control. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The codebase does not have any explicit integrations with other systems or services. However, it includes links to external platforms such as email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and CodersRank. These links enable users to interact with the portfolio owner through different platforms. Additional integrations, such as embedding social media feeds or third-party APIs, could enhance the functionality of the portfolio.|
| 📶 | **Scalability** | The website's scalability is limited as it does not include any backend functionality or dynamic content generation. However, the codebase can be easily expanded by adding new sections, projects, or updating the existing content as the developer's portfolio evolves. |

| [index.html](https://github.com/pmAdriaan/Bootstrap-Portfolio/blob/main/index.html) | The code is an HTML document that serves as the index page for a front-end web developer portfolio.

It also includes a favicon image and defines a navbar with links to different sections of the portfolio. The main content of the page is divided into a header and a main section, with a hero section included within the main section. |
